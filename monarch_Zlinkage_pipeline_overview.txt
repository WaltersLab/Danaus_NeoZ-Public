Part 1:  Average scaffold coverage.

1) Andrew aligned fastq files and calculated median coverage per scaffold with bedtools
2) "premiumzscaffolds_JRW.R" reads in median coverage per scaffold for 3xM and 3xF samples. It identifies putative Z-linked scaffolds via coverage, reporting:
-"Dplex_Zscaffs.txt", a list of z-linked scaffolds.
-"NormCov_DataFrame.R", normalized coverage dataframe for liftover script.
-"M-FCovRatio_N90all.pdf", plot of ratio by scaffold length
-"coverage_hist.pdf", histogram plot of coverage ratios.

Part 2: Liftover & Bubbleplots
1) Longest transcript was extracted as representative, translated to protein for proteinortho
2) Proteinortho run for each pairwise comparison: M.cinxia, H.melpomene, B.mori
3) "liftover_bubble_functions.R" contains generalized functions for doing liftover and bubble functions
4) "Dplex_liftovers.R" applies liftovers and generates chromosomal assignments for Dplex based on orthology.  Also generates outputs, for each species:
-Dplex gene and scaffold assignets to chromosome
-Plots of M:F coverage by scaffold, with chr21 & Z scaffs highlighted
-Bubbleplots of homology.

Part 3: Detailed scaffold coverage analysis.

1) Andrew generated basepair resolution covarage for  4 scaffolds: 01, 28, 44, and 403.
2) "byscaffoldcoverage_JRW.R" normalizes coverage by genome medians and plots differences between males and females.
3) this script also localizes breakpoints based on the max(difference) in adjacent windows of M:F coverage.
Outputs include:
-"max_mf_window_diff.pdf", plot of absolute differences in adjacent windows for finding ZA breakpoints
-"coverage_by_posxn.pdf", plots of Male and Female coverage
-"ZA_chimera_breaks.R", small data dump given predicted breakpoints

Part 4: reassigning scaffolds & genes to chromosomes.
1) "ZAbreaks_in_genes.R", a script to test whether the breaks fall inside genes.
2) revises gene-chr assignments from M.cinxia 
Outputs inlude:
-"Dplex_chr-gene-scaff_updated.txt", updated list of chr-gene-scaff set.
-"Dplex_GenePerChr_updated.txt", count of genes tabulated by chromosome.
